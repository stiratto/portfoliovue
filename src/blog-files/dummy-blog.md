## Why Learn Bash?

Learning Bash is essential for system administrators, developers, and anyone who wants to automate tasks, manage files, or manipulate processes on a Unix system.

With Bash, you can:

- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Efficiently control systems.

- Customize your work environment.


## Basic Bash Commands

Here are some of the most common commands in Bash:

### 1. `ls` - List files and directories

This command is used to display the files and directories in the current directory.

```js
const lol = "asd"
```

```bash
# For loop
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Number: \$i"
done

# While loop
counter=1
while [ \$counter -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Counter: $counter"
    counter=$((counter + 1))
done

# Until loop
counter=1
until [ \$counter -gt 5 ]; do
    echo "Counter: $counter"
    counter=$((counter + 1))
done

```
